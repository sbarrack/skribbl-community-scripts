# skribbl-community-scripts
A collection of user scripts for skribbl.io

## Installation
1. Install Tampermonkey browser extension
2. Paste "index.js" into a new script
3. Turn on automatic updates

## Usage
- Scroll to the *Don't Spell* menu on the landing page
  - Set your Discord username to post pictures
  - Choose a desired gamemode or "None" if none
  - Check the box next to "Color pallet" and paste a Skribbl Typo formatted pallet into the field below to use a custom pallet
  - Set the "Focus chat" keybind by choosing a modifier key, e.g. Shift, and/or optionally click the adjacent box to enter a different keyboard key
  - Set the "Brush size" keybind and "Brush color" keybind to one of the selections. Note, I do not recommend setting both to the same part of the keyboard
- Above the chat pane on the game page
  - Click any of the three buttons at the top to post an image to Discord
  - Brush mode changes which colors the magic brush uses
    - 1-cycle: Alternates between the light and dark version of a single color
    - 2-cycle: Alternates between your primary and secondary color selection (press "T" to switch your primary and secondary colors)
    - Light: Cycles through the top row of colors in the pallet
    - Dark: Cycles through the bottom row of colors in the pallet
    - All: Cycles through the full pallet
    - Grey: Cycles through the 4, leftmost colors of the pallet
  - "Speed (ms)" changes the rate at which the hatching tool draws lines and the magic brush changes color. Smaller values equals faster switching
- For usage of the new tools added to the toolbar on the bottom of the game page, hover over the icon for a tooltip with instructions
