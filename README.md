# Skribbl Community Scripts

A compilation of userscripts for Skribbl.io  

Skribbl Community Scripts is not affiliated with [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io/). This project is no longer maintained. It supports only archived versions of the site from before November 9th, 2022. Please see my new project [Spelln't](https://gitlab.com/sbarrack/spellnt) instead which will eventually include these features and more.  

## Installation

1. Install Tampermonkey browser extension
2. Paste `index.js` into a new Tampermonkey script

## Usage

- Secondary color slot
  - Pressing `T` swaps your primary and secondary color
- Brush modes
  - 1-cycle: Cycles light/dark on one color
  - 2-cycle: Alternates between your primary and secondary color selection
  - Light: Cycles through the top row of colors
  - Dark: Cycles through the bottom row of colors
  - All: Cycles through the full pallet
  - Grey: Cycles through the four left-most colors of the pallet
- `Speed (ms)` changes the hatching tool and magic brush frequency
  - A smaller period equals faster switching
