## Usage

- Above the chat pane on the game page
  - Brush mode changes which colors the magic brush uses
    - 1-cycle: Alternates between the light and dark version of a single color
    - 2-cycle: Alternates between your primary and secondary color selection (press "T" to switch your primary and secondary colors)
    - Light: Cycles through the top row of colors in the pallet
    - Dark: Cycles through the bottom row of colors in the pallet
    - All: Cycles through the full pallet
    - Grey: Cycles through the 4, leftmost colors of the pallet
  - "Speed (ms)" changes the rate at which the hatching tool draws lines and the magic brush changes color. Smaller values equals faster switching
